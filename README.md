## Installation

Go to Releases. Do something. Do something else. Don't complain. Be strong. Give up.

## Road-map
- âš  fix deploy process!
- consider using typescript and any test-suite (probbably just angular? is it normal to use angular for building browser extention?)
- download icons for permanent bookmarks (manual or pre-build task?)
- consider using [animate](https://animate.style/) css-library
- refactor all ðŸ’©

## ðŸ›£ Road-Map
- Re-think the hole conception, research on chrome bookmarks access.
- Consider using angular or at least jset/karma.
- Get rid of useless css/js libs and legacy code.
- Refactor html markup of override page
- Get rid of settings, or re-develop it.
